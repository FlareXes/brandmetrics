# BrandMetrics

BrandMetrics is a Django application for tracking brand performance, employee metrics, and order processing. Features include team chat and analytics. This README covers installation via Docker, pip, or `uv`.

## Demo Access

A live demo is available at: [https://brandmetrics-latest.onrender.com/](https://brandmetrics-latest.onrender.com/)

**Test Agent Credentials:**
- Email: super@gmail.com
- Password: admin@123

## NLP Approach

The application uses a rule-based NLP approach for intent parsing in the chat interface. Key features include:

- **Payroll Queries**: Supports time-based payroll queries like "this week", "this month", "last month", and custom date ranges (e.g., "from 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31")
- **Customer Orders**: Can retrieve orders by customer name using patterns like "customer John Doe" or "orders for John"
- **Implementation**: Uses simple string matching and regular expressions for intent classification in `parse_intent()`

## Security

- **Authentication**: Uses Django's built-in authentication system with ***password hashing***
- **Session Security**: Implements secure session management with CSRF protection
- **HTTPS**: Enforced for all connections in production
- **Password Policy**: Basic password strength requirements in place
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are properly escaped to prevent XSS attacks
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Uses Django ORM to prevent SQL injection

## Time Log / Key Decisions

- Implemented rule-based NLP for better control over specific query patterns
- Added support for Indian Standard Time (IST) in date calculations
- Limited order history display to 10 most recent entries for performance
- Used Django's built-in authentication with custom employee model extension
- Chose SQLite for simplicity in development and demo environments
- Deployed with 4 worker nodes for live demo
- Test agent account created with simple credentials for easy testing

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced NLP for intent parsing
- UI/UX Improvements

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13
- pip
- uv (optional)
- Docker (optional)

---

## Installation

### 1. Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t brandmetrics .
````

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 brandmetrics
```

3. Access the app at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)


---

### 2. Using pip

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Collect static files:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

### 3. Using uv

1. Install uv:

```bash
curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

2. Generate `requirements.txt` (optional):

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

4. Apply migrations and collect static files:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Running Scripts

Scripts are located under `scripts/`:

* `load_employees.py` — Load employee data
* `load_orders.py` — Load order data
* `load_payouts.py` — Load payout data

Example:

```bash
python scripts/load_employees.py
```

## Notes

* For development, `python manage.py runserver` is sufficient.
* For production, use Gunicorn or another WSGI server.
* `uv` ensures deterministic dependency installs across environments.
